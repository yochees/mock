I had an absolutely terrible experience with ACME Airlines on my recent flight and I need this resolved immediately. My name is Robert M. Johnson and I'm writing to complain about flight AC1847 from Chicago O'Hare to Miami International on November 15th, 2023. My Passenger Name Record is RJKMXP and the flight reference number is ACME-77B9K2.

First of all, my flight was delayed by over 3 hours with no proper explanation or compensation offered. I was traveling for my daughter's wedding and this delay caused me to miss the rehearsal dinner. When I tried to get information from your gate agents, they were completely unhelpful and rude. I specifically spoke with an agent named Sarah Martinez who told me to just wait and wouldn't provide any timeline updates.

The problems didn't stop there. When we finally boarded, my seat 12A was broken and wouldn't recline, and there was food spilled on the armrest that clearly hadn't been cleaned from the previous flight. The passenger next to me, a gentleman named Michael Chen, had the same issues with his seat 12B. The flight attendant named Patricia Williams said there were no other available seats despite the plane being only half full.

To make matters worse, when I tried to purchase food during the flight, your system had issues processing my credit card 4532-1234-5678-9012 which expires 08/26. The flight attendant ran it three times before it finally went through, and now I'm concerned about potential fraud charges. My phone number is 555-782-4391 if you need to reach me about this security issue.

I paid $487.50 for this flight and expect a full refund plus compensation for the terrible service. My confirmation email was sent to rob.johnson.1975@emailprovider.com and I have all the documentation saved. This was flight number AC1847 departing at what should have been 2:45 PM but didn't leave until 6:15 PM. I've been a loyal ACME Airlines customer for over 15 years but this experience has me seriously considering switching to your competitors permanently.
