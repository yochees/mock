I had a terrible experience with ACME Airlines on my recent flight and I need to file a formal complaint. My name is Robert Chen and I flew from Chicago O'Hare to Miami International on flight AC4287 on March 15th 2024. My Passenger Name Record is ABCD42 and my flight reference number is AC4287-CHI-MIA-031524.

The problems started at check-in when your staff couldn't locate my reservation even though I had my confirmation email. I had to wait 45 minutes in line just to get my boarding pass printed. Then when I got to my assigned seat 14C, there was already someone sitting there with a boarding pass for the same seat. The flight attendant was rude and acted like it was my fault. I eventually got moved to a middle seat in the back row next to the bathroom.

During the flight the air conditioning wasn't working properly and it was uncomfortably hot. The meal service was delayed by over an hour and when it finally came the food was cold and inedible. I asked for a blanket since I was cold from sitting near the bathroom but was told they ran out. The passenger next to me was coughing the entire flight without covering his mouth and when I asked to be moved I was told the flight was full.

To make matters worse, when I tried to access the in-flight WiFi that I paid extra for, it wasn't working for most of the flight. I paid for this service with my credit card 4532-1234-5678-9012 which is registered to Robert M Chen. I want a full refund for the WiFi charge at minimum. The flight was also delayed by 2 hours on arrival which caused me to miss my connecting ground transportation.

I've been a loyal customer of ACME Airlines for over 8 years but this experience has left me questioning whether I'll continue flying with your airline. I expect compensation for this poor service and I want assurance that steps will be taken to prevent this from happening to other passengers. Please contact me at your earliest convenience to resolve this matter.
