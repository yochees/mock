John Smith: Good afternoon, thank you for taking the time to speak with us today about your recent experience with ACME Airlines. Can you start by telling us about your overall impression of your flight?

Jana Sullivan: Well, let me tell you, it's been a real mixed bag with you guys. I mean, some things were absolutely fantastic, but others were just completely unacceptable. I'm honestly not sure where to start.

John Smith: Why don't you begin with what went well during your experience?

Jana Sullivan: Okay, so the boarding process was incredible. I've never seen anything like it. Your new mobile app system where I could just scan my phone and walk right on - brilliant! And the seats, oh my god, the new seats in economy are like business class from five years ago. The legroom, the USB ports, even little hooks for my headphones. I was blown away.

John Smith: That's great to hear. What about the in-flight service?

Jana Sullivan: The flight attendants were angels, absolute angels. Sarah, I think her name was, went above and beyond when my daughter spilled juice everywhere. She was patient, helpful, and even brought coloring books to keep the kids occupied. Your crew training is clearly top-notch.

John Smith: I'm glad our staff made a positive impression. Now, what areas caused you frustration?

Jana Sullivan: Oh boy, where do I even begin with the baggage situation. This is where I get really angry. We waited forty-five minutes at baggage claim, and when my luggage finally showed up, the handle was completely broken off. Completely! And when I went to report it, the baggage service desk was closed. Closed! At 8 PM on a Tuesday!

John Smith: I'm very sorry to hear about the baggage issues. Were you able to resolve this problem?

Jana Sullivan: Eventually, yes, but it took three phone calls over two days. Three! And each time I had to explain the entire situation from scratch because apparently your system doesn't keep proper notes. The first person told me I'd get a call back in 24 hours - never happened. The second person said they'd email me a claim form - never got it.

John Smith: That's clearly not the level of service we strive for. What about the airport experience itself?

Jana Sullivan: The check-in kiosks are fantastic, super user-friendly, but your signage throughout the terminal is absolutely terrible. We got lost trying to find our gate, and when we asked for directions, even your own employees seemed confused about the layout. It's like nobody talks to each other in your organization.

John Smith: How would you rate your likelihood of flying with ACME Airlines again?

Jana Sullivan: You know what, despite the baggage nightmare and the communication issues, I probably would fly with you again. The actual flying experience was so good, and those seats really are amazing. But you absolutely have to fix your ground operations and customer service follow-up. It's like you're two different companies.

John Smith: What would be the one thing we could do to improve your next experience?

Jana Sullivan: Get your baggage handling and customer service communication systems working properly. I shouldn't have to make three phone calls to report a broken suitcase. And for the love of all that's holy, fix the signage in your terminals. But keep doing whatever you're doing with the seats and the flight crew - that stuff is gold.
