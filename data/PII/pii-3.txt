I had an absolutely terrible experience with ACME Airlines on my recent flight and I need this resolved immediately. My name is Michael Patterson and I was traveling on flight AC2847 from Los Angeles to Chicago on March 15th, 2024. My Passenger Name Record is MPTRSN847XYZ and the flight reference number is AC-LAX-ORD-031524-789.

The problems started right from booking when I had to call three times to get my reservation confirmed. I paid $487.50 using my Visa credit card 4532 1234 5678 9012 which is under my name Michael J Patterson with expiration 08/2026 and security code 341. The booking agent assured me everything was set but when I arrived at LAX Terminal 4 at 6:30 AM for my 8:45 AM departure, there was no record of my reservation in the system.

After waiting in line for 45 minutes, your staff finally located my booking but then informed me that my seat assignment had been changed without notification. I had specifically requested and paid extra for seat 12A which is an aisle seat due to my knee problems, but was reassigned to 23F which is a middle seat in the back of the plane. When I complained, the gate agent was extremely rude and told me there was nothing they could do about it.

The flight itself was delayed by 2 hours and 20 minutes with no proper explanation or updates. We sat on the tarmac for over an hour before takeoff and the air conditioning was barely working. The flight attendants seemed overwhelmed and several passengers became agitated. My connecting flight information shows I was supposed to arrive at ORD at 1:15 PM but we didn't land until almost 4:00 PM, causing me to miss my important business meeting.

To make matters worse, my checked luggage with confirmation tag CHI047829 never arrived in Chicago. I'm still waiting for it to be located and delivered to my hotel at the Marriott Downtown Chicago. This bag contains important business documents and medication that I need immediately. My phone number is 555-298-7431 and my email is michael.patterson.work@gmail.com for any updates.

I'm extremely disappointed with ACME Airlines and expect full compensation for this disaster of a travel experience. This level of service is completely unacceptable and I will be filing complaints with the Department of Transportation if this matter is not resolved promptly. Please contact me immediately to discuss how you plan to make this right.
