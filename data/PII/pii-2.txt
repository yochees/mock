I had a terrible experience with ACME Airlines on my recent flight and I need someone to address this immediately. My name is Michael Thompson and I booked flight AC2847 from Chicago to Miami on March 15th 2024. My Passenger Name Record is XKTM89 and the flight reference number was ACM-447821-PNR.

I paid for this disaster of a flight using my credit card 4532 1234 5678 9012 which was charged $387.50 for what was supposed to be a premium economy seat. The flight was delayed by 3 hours with no explanation given to passengers. When we finally boarded, my seat 14A was broken and wouldn't recline, and there was sticky residue all over the armrest that looked like it hadn't been cleaned in weeks.

The flight attendants were incredibly rude when I asked about the delay and one of them actually rolled her eyes at me when I requested a blanket. The food service was a joke - they ran out of meal options by the time they got to row 14 and I was left with stale crackers and warm soda. To make matters worse, the entertainment system was completely non-functional for the entire 3 hour flight.

When I tried to use the bathroom halfway through the flight, it was absolutely disgusting with paper towels all over the floor and no soap in the dispenser. This is completely unacceptable for an airline that charges premium prices. I travel frequently for business and have never experienced such poor service. I expect a full refund to my card ending in 9012 and a formal apology from ACME Airlines management. My frequent flyer number is AT9871234 and I'm seriously considering switching to another airline permanently if this isn't resolved quickly.
