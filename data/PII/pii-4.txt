I had an absolutely terrible experience with ACME Airlines on my recent flight and I need this resolved immediately. My name is Robert Chen and my Passenger Name Record is XYZ789. I was traveling on flight AC4521 from Los Angeles to Chicago on November 15th with flight reference number ACME-45210-RCH-091523.

First off, my flight was delayed by over 3 hours with no proper explanation from your staff. I had to miss an important business meeting because of this delay. When I tried to get information at the gate, your employees were completely unhelpful and rude. I specifically spoke with a gate agent named Sarah who just kept saying mechanical issues without any details.

The problems continued once we finally boarded the aircraft. My seat 14A was broken and wouldn't recline at all. The passenger next to me was extremely disruptive throughout the entire flight, talking loudly on his phone during taxiing despite being told multiple times by flight attendants to turn it off. The food service was also delayed and when it finally came, my special meal request for vegetarian was completely ignored.

To make matters worse, when I tried to use the entertainment system, it was completely non-functional. The screen was cracked and wouldn't respond to touch. I paid extra for this seat specifically because it was supposed to have premium entertainment options. This is unacceptable for the price I paid.

I charged this flight to my credit card 4532 1234 5678 9012 and I expect a full refund given the horrible service. My phone number is 555-234-7890 and my email is robert.chen.personal@gmail.com. I've been a loyal ACME Airlines customer for over 8 years but this experience has me seriously considering switching to your competitors. I expect prompt resolution of this matter and appropriate compensation for the inconvenience caused.
